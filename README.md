## üîß Build Instructions Using VS Code (with MinGW)

1. **Install MinGW-w64** and add it to your system PATH.

2. **Open VS Code** and ensure the C/C++ extension is installed.

3. **Open a terminal** in the `src/` directory.

4. **Compile the source files** using:
   ```bash
   gcc child_echo.c -o child_echo.exe
   gcc create_basic.c -o create_basic.exe
   gcc create_two_children.c -o create_two_children.exe
   gcc replace_sim.c -o replace_sim.exe 
   ```

## üìù Notes on Tasks

### **Task A ‚Äì Creating a Single Child**
- Successfully created a child process using `CreateProcess()`.
- Verified parent and child PIDs.

### **Task B ‚Äì Creating Two Children**
- Created two child processes and handled their execution.
- Demonstrated both normal termination and forced termination.

### **Task C ‚Äì Simulating exec()**
- Parent spawns a new process (`cmd /c dir`) and waits for it to finish.
- Exits with the same exit code as the spawned process.
- Parent ends quickly after child completes, simulating `exec()` behavior.

### **Task D ‚Äì Process Management in PowerShell**
- Used `Get-Process child_echo` to list running child processes.
- Used `Stop-Process -Id <PID>` to terminate processes.
- Observed difference between normal termination (clean exit) vs forced termination.
